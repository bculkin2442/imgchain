@TODO Oct 6th, 2020 - Ben Culkin - :FilePipes
	Add an ability to write/read pipelines from a file. This will likely
	involve some fairly serious reconsideration of how stages are configured.

@TODO Oct 6th, 2020 - Ben Culkin - :StageChaining
	Some better ability to chain stages together without the inefficency
	of running them one after the other. This won't work great for stages which
	depend on the context of pixels around, but should work fine for most others.
